# KANBAN-BOARD
A Kanban board project helps you manage tasks and workflows effectively. They help teams visualize their work, identify bottlenecks, and continuously improve their processes.

## Project Overview
The Kanban Project is a web-based application that implements the Kanban methodology for managing tasks. It provides a visual representation of workflows using boards, columns, and cards. Each card represents a task that can be moved across columns to indicate its progress.

Each work item is represented by a card that is placed on the board. As the work item moves through the workflow, the card is moved from column to column. This allows the team to see at a glance which tasks are in progress, which tasks are waiting, and which tasks have been completed.

The main goal of this project is to help individuals or teams organize their work, track progress, and collaborate efficiently.

## Features
1. Create multiple boards to manage different projects or workflows.
2. Add custom columns to each board to reflect your specific workflow stages.
3. Create, edit, and delete cards within each column to represent tasks.
4. Drag and drop cards across columns to update their status or progress.
5. Assign labels, due dates, and priorities to cards for better organization.
6. Collaborate with team members by sharing boards and assigning tasks.
